            <h5>A Quick Summary</h5>
            <ul>
               <li>Neolithic art and funerary practices demonstrate that women were the equals of men</li>
               <li>Minoan Crete marks the last instance of this social and religious organizational pattern - devoid of the dominator culture</li>
               <li>The Kurgan wave brought about the violent transition to a dominator culture - whereby the class in power was able to dominate over the majority weaker classes through violence, repression and fear</li>
               <li>The dominator culture does not specifically mean male dominated cultures; however historically the main group in positions of dominance have been males - notable exceptions would be Margrette Thatcher, Madiline Albright and Hillary Clinton</li>
               <li>There is a lot to learn from this work, which does not advocate feminism specifically, but rather a balance in cooperation between female and male perspectives</li>

            <h5> On The Chalice and The Blade</h5>
            <p>
               As one acquainted with Riane Eisler's book ''The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future'' from its inception, I am writing regarding the distortion and misrepresentation of this remarkable book as antimale ''science fiction'' by its reviewer, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese (Oct. 4).
      <br><br>
               I am one of 19 social scientists and other scholars, both male and female, who reviewed this book prior to its recent publication. Because its reconstruction of our past, present and future is based on neglected (and even suppressed) as well as long-established findings from a wide range of fields, and because this reconstruction differs so greatly from traditional (including the reviewer's Marxist) views, sections relevant to their expertise were screened for accuracy by two archeologists, two historians, an anthropologist, two systems theorists, three sociologists, three psychologists, three religious studies scholars, two art historians and an economist. They include the following authorities well known in their respective fields, in alphabetical order: Ralph Abraham, Jessie Bernard, Carol Christ, Marija Gimbutas, Wilma Scott Heide, Hazel Henderson, Mara Keller, Ervin Laszlo, Jean Baker Miller, Ashley Montagu, Nicolas Platon, Merlin Stone, Charles Tilly, Barbara Walker. In contrast to the reviewer's attempt to trivialize this extraordinary work, assessments by the above group ranged from ''groundbreaking'' and ''catalytic and pioneering'' to ''the most important book since Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' ''
   <br><br>
               Rather than resorting to distorting omission (for example, failure to even hint at the archeological evidence discussed at length in the book, backing its conclusions), quoting out of context and ridicule, an honest review from someone who believes (and this is a quotation from the review within context) that ''violent conflict'' is the ''midwife to some of the greatest leaps toward freedom,'' and who intimates that war is just ''human nature,'' would have openly addressed the author's and the reviewer's fundamental ideological differences. DAVID LOYE Carmel, Calif. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese replies:
      <br><br>
               Mr. Loye's spirited defense notwithstanding, Ms. Eisler's book stands on its merits and no appeal to the endorsements of learned authorities can either save or condemn it. For that reason, I remain unmoved by Mr. Loye's roster and unshaken in my judgment. My Marxism, as Mr. Loye well knows, is quite irrelevant. In fact, as Mr. Loye should know, most contemporary Marxists would more likely agree with Ms. Eisler's assumptions about human nature than with my own. The issue does not concern the interpretation of human nature - over which disagreement has persisted since the dawn of literacy. It concerns the quality of Ms. Eisler's historical scholarship. I persist in the view that that scholarship is riddled with absurdities and find it hard to believe that the overwhelming majority of historians will not share my judgment.

               “Through the use of the dominator and partnership models of social organization for the analysis of both our present and our potential future, we can also begin to transcend the conventional polarities between right and left, capitalism and communism, religion and secularism, and even masculinism and feminism.”
